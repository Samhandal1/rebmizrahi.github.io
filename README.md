McWics Hackathon submission 2022

We created this project in order for women to have a user friendly and trigger-safe way to assess crime rates in the areas they wish to travel to. We used data from Statistics Canada for our prototype. In future iterations, we would have an algorithm to filter through multiple databases as well as newspaper articles in order to turn sheTravels into an international database.
